# PSP-Inventory

## What does it do

The PSP-Inventory module provides new cmdlets for you to inventorise your Windows environment.  
The following items are collected for you:

- System Info [CPU/Mem etc]
- Operating System Info
- Disk Info
- Network Info
- Installed Software
- Installed Security Updates
- Installed Server Roles
- Installed Certificates
- Scheduled Tasks
- Local Groups
- Local Users

The module has been created with a mindset to be able to quickly make an inventory of a new environment, providing default information required to get to know new systems.
Seeing that I tend to work on a project basis a lot for different companies, getting inventory data really helps me with quickly evaluating the systems I need to work on.
It might also simply help with keeping track of changes made on a system over time by re-running cmdlets and comparing the data collected.

## Installing PSP-Inventory

```powershell
# Install PSP-Inventory from the Powershell Gallery
Find-Module PSP-Inventory | Install-Module -AllowClobber
```

The `-AllowClobber` function is currently still required as explained in [issue #1](https://github.com/powershellpr0mpt/PSP-Inventory/issues/1)

### Examples

Here's a few simple examples on how to use the module for basic inventory needs.
Do note that as stated in [issue #2](https://github.com/powershellpr0mpt/PSP-Inventory/issues/2) I'm looking to create external help, which will provide information on each cmdlet for easy viewing.
All cmdlets currently already provide comment based help available within PowerShell itself.

#### Getting Network information

```powershell
#Collect the list of computers to query
$Computers = Get-Content 'C:\Temp\Computers.txt'
Get-NicInfo -ComputerName $Computers -Drivers | Format-Table

ComputerName Alias    Index PhysicalAdapter IPAddress                                 Status    MacAddress        DHCPEnabled DHCPServer DNSServers
------------ -----    ----- --------------- ---------                                 ------    ----------        ----------- ---------- ----------
DC2012R2     Ethernet 10               True {192.168.14.3, fe80::e456:f730:f610:7eac} Connected 00:17:FB:00:00:00       False            {127.0.0.1}
SRV2012      Ethernet 10               True {192.168.14.5, fe80::2d7c:d6b8:d670:38df} Connected 00:17:FB:00:00:02       False            {192.168.14.3}
SRV2016CORE  Ethernet 1                True {192.168.14.6, fe80::a438:7d49:4f12:b000} Connected 00:17:FB:00:00:03       False            {192.168.14.3}
SRV2019CORE  Ethernet 1                True {192.168.14.7, fe80::31f3:d92a:a4b9:e3a8} Connected 00:17:FB:00:00:04       False            {192.168.14.3}
```

#### Finding installed software and export it to Excel

This depends on the availability of the [ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel) module on your system

```powershell
$Software = Get-Software -ComputerName NYC-DC01

$Software | Export-Excel -Path "$Home\Inventory\Inventory.xlsx" -WorksheetName 'Software' -Append -AutoSize -AutoFilter -FreezeTopRowFirstColumn
```

This will provide you an Excel sheet work a worksheet named Software containing all the collected data.
It will be automatically sized, filtered and the top row and first column will be frozen.

If there's already data in this Excel sheet, it will automatically append the data to it instead of overwriting it.
